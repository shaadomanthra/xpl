Employers who provide flexibility, professional growth opportunities, and a feeling of purpose are most valued by millennials (those aged 22 to 37).

                  <p>Corporate principles and strategies are aligned with high-quality training. Going above and beyond the essentials demonstrates that a company is prepared to make long-term investments in its employees.

                  <p>Because of a lack of development chances, 74% of employees believe they aren't attaining their full potential. Corporate training focuses on addressing shortcomings and enhancing existing skills. Employees who have received enough training experience have improved their skills, competency, and confidence in their talents. As a result, these personnel can do a better job and generate higher-quality work.</p>

    <h2 >Types of Corporate Training</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">Depending on their size, diversity, and the characteristics of their industry, different organisations may have a variety of training programmes. The following is a list of typical corporate training programmes:</p>
   

            <div class="row text-md-left text-center">
              <div class="col-sm-6 mb-3 mb-sm-5">
                <!-- Icon Blocks -->
                <div class="pr-lg-6">
                  <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Orientation and onboarding</h4>
                  <p>This type of training begins as soon as a newly hired employee arrives at work and continues until the person is able to operate independently. Its primary goal is to speed up the new employee onboarding process by making them feel more at ease and productive.</p>
                  <p>The onboarding training programme can be customised. However, it usually consists of two parts:
                    <ul>
                      <li>For New Hires: It contains general company information, such as its history, mission, vision, and values, as well as corporate policies and regulations.</li>

                      <li>For a Particular Role: This focuses on acquiring basic information and abilities that a new hire will need to succeed in a particular position.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Compliance training</h4>
                  <p>Compliance training is frequently included in new hire onboarding and is a necessity. It's usually a structured programme that focuses on corporate regulations or guidelines, allowing employees and employers to avoid both workplace difficulties and legal breaches.</p>
                  <p>These regulations and procedures are usually related to specific employment or sector. What workers should be compliant with and what kind of training is required can also be influenced by location. Anti-harassment and diversity training programmes, company ethics, workplace safety, and data protection and privacy training are all examples of compliance training.

                  <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Training in Hard Skills</h4>
                  <p>There's always space for growth, no matter how professional employees are. Employee development is centred on hard skills since this type of training allows employees to strengthen the abilities they require in their jobs and become even better professionals. A graphic designer who has mastered Photoshop, for example, can advance by learning how to work in other design software. At the same time, a programmer who is proficient in CSS and JavaScript can receive additional training to understand Python programming. To stay current with the latest advances, employees must undergo frequent training.</p>
                
                  <h4 class="mt-4"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Training in Soft Skills</h4>
                  <p>Companies should not disregard soft skill training because how staff behave is just as important as what they know. According to studies, employees can favourably improve the company's profitability and increase ROI by developing soft skills.</p>
                  <p>Communication, problem-solving, and decision-making are examples of soft talents that pertain to interpersonal relationships. They assist employees in interacting with their coworkers and customers in a productive and pleasant manner. They're crucial for attracting new customers, boosting customer service, and forming a solid team.</p>

                  <h4 class="mt-4"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Training on product knowledge</h4>
                  <p>Product knowledge is the ability of team members to thoroughly comprehend and convincingly speak with customers about what you offer, including its features, benefits, applications, and costs. This training is frequently provided as part of a new hire's onboarding programme. It's also beneficial for employees who need to brush up on the company's products and services, and it's held whenever a new feature or product is released so that everyone is up to date.</p>

    <h2 >What constitutes an effective training programme?</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">Without a doubt, everyone has their own view of what constitutes a "good training programme." The truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all plan for the optimum training programme. However, some aspects are universal in all successful training programmes, regardless of industry, workforce size, programme aim, geography, or demography.</p>

                  <h4><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Relevance and Need</h4>
                  <p>The experience and knowledge you provide employees must be current, relevant, and appropriate to their day-to-day tasks. It should assist them in broadening their knowledge and abilities, and it should be simple to understand so that they can learn quickly and put what they've learned into practice. </p>
                 

                  <h4 class="mt-4"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Alignment</h4>
                  <p>Everything taught to employees must be in line with the company's objectives. Instead of asking employees what training they want or need, it is essential to focus on the business goals and then the competencies required to accomplish them. Then, it can be decided on which skills employees require training on.

                  <p>When designing training programmes, it should be made sure they are goal-oriented and that the Key Performance Indicators chosen offer a comprehensive picture of the program's time, cost, effectiveness, quality, and quantity.</p>
                
                  <h4 class="mt-4"><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Creativity</h4>
                  <p>Workplace learning is changing to the point where adding entertaining and relevant activities to training is becoming more common as a way to boost employee engagement. Moving away from typical trainer-style learning or an online learning experience that resembles flipping through a PowerPoint presentation will allow exploring more creative options.</p>
