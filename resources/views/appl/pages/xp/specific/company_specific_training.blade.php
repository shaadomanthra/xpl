                    <p>With different companies testing different skills from candidates, it is essential to be prepared for all of them. 
                        Undergoing training for general recruitment rounds is only the first step. The next step is to train for each organization specifically.</p>
                    <p>Without knowing anyone from the companies that candidates apply to, it may become difficult to prepare specifically. That is where Xplore comes in. Xplore offers customized company-specific training. Xplore's company-specific
                        training solutions are simple yet effective, with the singular goal of assisting students in passing specific company recruitment tests.</p>

                            It's an online test where candidates will be asked MCQ questions on anything from verbal to quantitative to essential areas like DS, Networking, OOPS, and Database. As the number of questions is more, additional practice is needed.
                          </p>
                          <p>The second section (quantitative aptitude) covers moderate to challenging problems on time, speed, distance, permutation and combination, number series, equations, analytical puzzles, algebra, probability, etc. Candidates will have 35 minutes to answer ten questions.</p>    
                          <p>In the last segment, time management is critical because there are only 35 minutes for 40 questions (verbal ability). Fill-in-the-blanks, synonyms, antonyms, paragraph completion, vocabulary,
                          phrase correction, and other activities are common. Because there is no negative marking, candidates should try and attempt all questions.</p>
