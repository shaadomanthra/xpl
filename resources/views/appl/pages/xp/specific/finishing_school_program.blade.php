            <p class="mb-0" style="line-height: 35px;">Talent Sprint's three-month Engineering Finishing School is
              designed to impart technological training, improve critical thinking, and refine English communication
              along with interview preparation skills for recently graduated students and students who have 60%
              aggregate in 10th,12th and graduation. All of this is complemented by regular tests and feedback to help
              students develop their abilities. Students are also exposed to the business ecosystem through mentoring
              programmes and contacts with industry professionals
              and advisers at the finishing school. The Engineering Finishing School's primary goal is to make
              engineering students employable.</p>

            </div>

          <p>As a lot of our environment is automated, computer programming is essential nowadays. Humans need to be
            able to govern how humans and robots interact. We use computer programming to harness
            the computational power of computers and machines since they are so efficient and accurate. To do so,
            students must first master the foundations of programming.</p>
          <div>
            <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
            <p>Object-Oriented Computer, or OOPs,
              refers to programming languages that make use of objects. Inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, and other
              real-world concepts are all part of object-oriented programming. </p>
            <p>Object-oriented programming languages are essential since they save development time by allowing the
              reuse of code and creating models based on objects. They are clean and effective. This approach also
              tackles common procedural programming issues, such as tedious code. The software development process is
              more efficient, and the code is more readable. In an effort to grow, significant corporations turned to
              OOP languages
              a while back. Object-oriented programming is the dominant approach used by companies like Microsoft and
              platform environments like Delphi.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>SQL and JDBC</h2>
            <p>SQL is a highly specialized programming language with a narrow set of applications. SQL is a programming
              language for accessing, analyzing, and manipulating data in massive digital databases.
              This is especially useful for larger businesses whose choices depend a lot on the tales that their data
              tells.</p>
            <p>
              Java Database Connection, or JDBC, is a standard Java API enabling database-independent connectivity
              between the Java programming language and a variety of databases. For building real-world Java
              applications, JDBC is essential. Because data is the most essential component of every programme, and JDBC
              is the most fundamental technique to deal with data in a Java application, understanding JDBC will help
              students become better Java developers.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Algorithmic Thinking</h2>
            <p>Algorithms are steps or instructions that computers use to solve a
              problem and achieve a specific objective. Learning algorithms is essential for designing and developing
              effective computer programmes.</p>

          <h2>UI (HTML, CSS, JS)</h2>
          <p>Websites are built using the HTML and CSS frameworks. When students learn how to use these two and
            collaborate, they excel in design, marketing, and a variety of other fields. </p>
          <p>JavaScript is a scripting language or programming language that allows sophisticated functionality
            implementation on websites. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
            information — providing timely content updates, interactive maps, dynamic 2D/3D visuals, scrolling video
            jukeboxes, and so on — JavaScript is almost certainly involved.</p>
          <p>The most obvious reason to learn JavaScript is to improve your web development skills. Students that are
            fluent in this language will be able to create websites from the ground up, which is a beneficial ability in
            today's employment market!</p>

              </div> 
            </div>

            <p>It is a Java programming language feature. It is a web-based, network-centric, or enterprise application
              development technology. It is a version of Java that is designed explicitly for developing web-based,
              network-centric, or enterprise applications. It covers essential topics, such as Servlet, JSP, JDBC, RMI,
              and socket programming, among others. It is a domain-specific speciality. </p>
            <p>It's used to create general-purpose software and create an internet application and a mobile app. For
              web-based and business applications, advanced Java is utilized.</p>

              <h2>Spring Boot with Angular</h2>
              <p>Spring Boot enables developers to construct apps that are ready to use right away. By embedding a web
                server such as Tomcat within an app during the startup phase, developers can make independent apps that
                run without the need for an external web server.</p>

              groundwork for applications and services to run smoothly. These technologies vary from bare metal to
              serverless computing and allow the business to make use of cloud computing's advantages. Hence, students

          <h2>Quantitative Aptitude</h2>
          <p>Quantitative aptitude assesses a candidate's arithmetic competence and problem-solving abilities. It is a
            required component of nearly all competitive examinations and recruiting assessments. It is one of the
            sections used to filter out candidates because not everyone possesses the necessary skill sets to pass this
            part. People who are skilled at it, on the other hand, have an opportunity to turn it into a high-scoring
            part and improve their chances of passing the test. </p>
          <div>
            <h2>Reasoning Ability</h2>
            <p>The purpose of logical reasoning exams is to assess a candidate's skill or aptitude to think logically.
              They are nonverbal tests that measure the ability to analyze via logical and abstract thinking, extracting
              principles and structures to assist in identifying the correct answer from a set of alternatives. Overall,
              logical reasoning is focused on what someone can deduce from sequences and patterns. Thus it's considered
              pure reasoning ability.</p>

            <h2>Verbal Ability</h2>
            <p>One of the most popular psychometric (or aptitude) tests used to assess a candidate's eligibility and
              potential is the verbal aptitude exam.
              On the basic verbal aptitude test, a candidate must recognize word analogies, construct phrases, or
              identify word synonyms/antonyms. It assesses a person's capacity to communicate and absorb information in
              English in the workplace.

            <p>A solid understanding of business English allows one to communicate in English more successfully and

              in everyday business settings, such as presentations, negotiations, meetings, small chats, socializing,
              drafting reports, and C.V. writing.</p>
            <p>Studying business English will also guarantee that you can communicate in English via email. Email is the
